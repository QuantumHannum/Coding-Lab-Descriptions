# Combining Multiple Gaussian Pulses

In quantum computing, gates are implemented by applying controlled rotations to a qubit, and these rotations are often constructed by combining several pulses in sequence. By stringing multiple pulses together, we can build more complex operations than a single pulse can provide—for example, performing a rotation about an arbitrary axis, decomposing a gate into simpler components, or creating sequences that move the qubit around the Bloch sphere in precise and intentional ways. Exploring how pulses add together to produce cumulative rotations helps reveal how quantum gates are engineered in practice and how control sequences shape the evolution of a quantum state.

## Activity 4: String pulses together
Lets alter your basic code from Part 1 to accomodate multiple pulses to the initial state.
